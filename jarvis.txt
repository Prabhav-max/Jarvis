            Python Text To Speech| pyttsx module


pyttsx is a cross-platform text to speech library which is platform independent.The major advantage of using this library for text-to-speech conversion is that it works offline.
 However, pyttsx supports only Python 2.x. Hence, we will see pyttsx3 which is modified to work 
 on both Python 2.x and Python 3.x with the same code.

Use this command for Installation:

pip install pyttsx3
 
Usage â€“
First we need to import the library and then initialise it using init() function.
 This function may take 2 arguments.
      init(driverName string, debug bool)
drivername : [Name of available driver] sapi5 on Windows | nsss on MacOS
debug: to enable or disable debug output
After initialisation, we will make the program speak the text using say() function.
 This method may also take 2 arguments.
      say(text unicode, name string)

text : Any text you wish to hear.
name : To set a name for this speech. (optional)\
